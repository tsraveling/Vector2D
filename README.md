# Vector2D
A C++ implementation of Vector2 that uses double (ie double precision, 64-bit) instead of 32 bit floats. I use this personally for orbital mechanics math, but it should serve any project requiring large numbers with high precision, without having to recompile the Godot engine to convert all Vector2 to double precision.
